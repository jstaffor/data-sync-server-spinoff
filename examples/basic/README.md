## Basic Example

`basic/index.js` is the simplest example of how to use the `voyager-server` framework.

```
$ node basic/index.js
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Open [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and you will see the GraphQL Playground. This is a space where you can try out queries and see the results.

Try the following query.

```
query hello {
  hello
}
```
