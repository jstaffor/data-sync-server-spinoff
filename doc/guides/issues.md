# Opening Issues

## JIRA

The AeroGear team tracks issues for all of the AeroGear projects in the [AeroGear Project](https://issues.jboss.org/projects/AEROGEAR/issues) in the [JBoss Developer JIRA](https://issues.jboss.org). We do prefer if you sign up and create issues there. See the [AeroGear JIRA Usage and Guidelines Guide](https://aerogear.org/docs/guides/JIRAUsage/) for information on how the issue tracker relates to contributions to this project.

## GitHub

We understand that for some people, JIRA can be a barrier to entry for creating issues and contributing in general. The maintainers of the Apollo Voyager Server welcome issues created in GitHub. Feel free to [Create an Issue](https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server/issues/new) and select from one of our issue templates. We will do our best to triage these issues in GitHub.

## Asking for Help

If you have a question about Apollo Voyager Server that is not a bug report or feature
request, feel free to [create an issue using the help issue template](https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server/issues/new?template=3-help.md).

You can also reach the aerogear team at [#aerogear](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/aerogear) on [Freenode IRC](https://freenode.net/) or the 
[aerogear google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aerogear).
